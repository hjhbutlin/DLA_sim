Diffusion limited aggregation (DLA) is the process by which particles undergoing Brownian-dominated motion randomly walk until they hit each other, sticking to make an aggregate of particles. These aggregations tend to exhibit a branching structure and are the basis of many chemical and biological processes.

I used this project was an introduction to C# and 2D rendering using SFML.
